                    <h3>The Mystery of Kailasha Temple</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Kailasha temple is the largest of the rock-cut temples at the Ellora Caves near Chhatrapati Sambhajingar district, Maharashtra, India. The remarkable Kailasa Temple stands nestled within the breathtaking Ellora Cave №16 in Maharashtra's Aurangabad district. Built in the 8th century by the talented King Krishna I of the Rashtrakuta dynasty, this temple is more than just a structure — it's a testament to ancient artistry and devotion.
                        The temple was crafted by chiseling away a U-shaped rock, removing a staggering 2 lakh tons of rock in the process. Now, you all know most stone-carved temples are sculpted from the front, right? But this 90-feet-high Kailasa Temple? It's carved from top to bottom! Talk about defying expectations. It's not just any temple — it's the most incredible structure in the world carved from a single stone! The architectural style is a blend of Pallava and Chalukya influences, making it a true masterpiece.
                        Legend has it that the stones used in the temple are unbreakable. Yup, you heard that right — unbreakable! Even the notorious Islamic invader Aurangzeb couldn't lay a finger on them. In 1862, he ordered 1000 soldiers to demolish the temple, but despite their efforts over three long years, they couldn't even make a dent. Now that's what you call indestructible!
                        Here's where things take a mysterious turn. During the British rule, there was research conducted on the caves below the temple. But guess what? High levels of radioactivity made it nearly impossible to continue. Some say it's because there could be ancient weapons or tools used in the temple's construction down there. Even after independence, these caves remain closed. Archaeologists speculate that there might be a whole other world beyond those caves. And where does all that radioactive radiation come from? It's a mystery, as it usually only comes from one source in caves.

                    <h3>Veerabhadra Temple- The gravity defying Hanging Pillar</h3>
                    <p>
                        Veerabhadra temple is a Hindu temple located in Lepakshi, in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The temple is dedicated to the Virabhadra, a fierce form of the god Shiva.
                        Built in the 16th century, the architectural features of the temple are in the Vijayanagara style with a profusion of carvings and paintings at almost every exposed surface of the temple. It is one of the centrally protected monuments of national importance and is considered one of the most spectacular Vijayanagara temples. The fresco paintings are particularly detailed in very bright dresses and colors with scenes of Rama and Krishna from the epic stories of the Ramayana, the Mahabharata, and the Puranas and they are well preserved.
                        There is a very large Nandi (bull), mount of Shiva, about 200 meters (660 ft) away from the temple which is carved from a single block of stone, which is said to be one of the largest of its type in the world.
                        The shrine dedicated to Lord Veerabhadra, the Lepakshi Temple is an exhibition of timeless art which includes beautiful frescoes and murals. Much of the temple is built on a low, rocky hill called Kurmasailam ("tortoise hill" in Telugu) - inspired by the shape of the hill.
                        Carved in its walls are images of musicians and saints. You will see beautiful dancing Ganesha moorti, murtis of Mata Parvati and Lord Shiva. There is also a cave chamber here where Sage Agasthya is said to have lived.
                        The temple is famed for another engineering wonder. Among the 70 stone pillars, there is one that hangs from the ceiling.

                    <h3>The Ananthapura Lake Temple</h3>
                    <p>The only Lake temple of Kerala is situated in a sleepy hamlet 'Ananthapura' in Kasaragod district,
                        Kerala. The 9th-century temple is believed to be the moolasthanam or original abode of Lord Anantha
                        Padmanabha, the deity of the famous Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Kerala's capital,
                        Thiruvananthapuram.
                        Sree Anantha Padmanabha is depicted as seated on the divine serpent Anantha. An exceptional

                        collection of wood carvings that show scenes from Dashavatharam (the 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu)
                        can be seen on the ceilings of the mandapam (pavilion) here. Carvings of the Nava grahams (nine
                        planets) and Dwarapalakar (gatekeepers) can also be found in different parts of this temple. Another unique thing about this temple is Babiya, a vegan crocodile who lived in the lake, was
                        considered that she protects the temple. It is believed that it ate only temple offerings that were
                        served to her twice a week and never harmed a single human. People used to feed her with their hands
                        and she ate the the prasadam cooked at temple. It died aged 75 on October 9, 2022.
                        The past of the temple is still obscure except for some myths. It was at this place where Divakara

                        Muni Vilwamangalam, the great Brahmin sage, did penance and performed poojas. Legend has it that one
                        day Lord Narayana appeared before him as a child. The boy's face was glowing with radiance and this
                        overwhelmed the sage. He became anxious and asked who he was. The boy replied that he had no father
                        no mother and none at home.

                    <h3>Stambheshwar Mahadev-The Shivling installed by Lord Kartikeya</h3>
                    <p>  Skanda Purana, one of 18 Hindu puranas, has references to this temple. After slaying Tarkasur,
                        Kartikeya asked the Gods that how will be absolve himself of the sin of killing a devotee of Lord
                        Shiv. Lord Vishnu consoled him-'Killing a wicked person, who nourishes himself on the blood of
                        innocent people, is not a sinful deed. But, still, if you feel guilty, the best way to atone for
                        your sin is establish Shiva lingas and worship them with deep devotion.'

                        Kartikeya installed these Shivalingas at three different places with proper rituals in the presence
                        of Maa Parvati and all other Gods. Stambeshwar is one of the three shrines where these Shivlings
                        were established.

                        The Shivalinga at this temple is said to have been created by Lord Kartikeya, the elder son of Lord
                        Shiva. The story begins with Lord Kartikeya feeling a deep sense of guilt after killing Tarakasura,
                        a fervent devotee of Lord Shiva. Despite Lord Vishnu assuring him that vanquishing a wicked person
                        was not wrong, the guilt lingered.

                        Tarakasura, according to Hindu mythology, was an Asura (demon) who had shown immense dedication
                        through Tapasya (a Sanskrit term for sincere devotion and prayer) and received two powerful boons
                        from Lord Brahma. One boon stipulated that only the son of Lord Shiva could kill him. At that time,
                        Lord Shiva had not yet remarried after the death of Sati, who had been reborn as Parvati.

                        After acquiring the boons, Tarakasura turned evil, causing immense suffering to both people and
                        deities. The other gods, troubled by his actions, sought Lord Shiva's help. Aware of the boon, Lord
                        Shiva assured them that Tarakasura's end was near. The battle against the demons, led by Lord
                        Kartikeya, resulted in the fulfillment of the prophecy as he killed Tarakasura.

                    <h3>The Divine Nidhivan Temple</h3>
                    <p>Vrindavan is witness to the childhood of Lord Krishna and hence has many places where the lord
                        himself has performed many playful acts. Nidhivan in Vrindavan is one such temple which has seen the
                        notorious acts of the Lord himself. This beautiful orchard of Tulsi in Vrindavan is a pious
                        destination that draws attention of many devotees due to the many mysteries associated with it. As
                        the name signifies, Nidihivan implies to a treasured (Nidhi) forest (van). True to its name, this
                        pious place is home to many rare species of plants that keep the premises flocked with devout
                        atmosphere. According to the legends, every plant in the Nidhivan Temple is the disguised Gopi who
                        had participated in the Maha Raas with Lord Krishna.

                        The mysterious Nidhivan Temple in Vrindavan, is the place which witnessed the dance of Lord Krishna
                        called the Raas Leela. Devotees and local people still believe that Lord Krishna visits this place
                        every night and performs Raas Leela with the Gopis and Radha Rani. Due to this belief, the doors of
                        Nidhivan Temple are closed in the night, after the evening aarti even for priests and workers of the
                        temple. The folklores have it that Nidhivan Mandir is the place of privacy for Lord, and hence
                        should be left alien in the night. The pious place becomes vacant so much so that the animals and
                        birds seen during the daytime leave the place after the evening. Nidhivan Temple also has a Kunj in
                        it, in which the divine Lord Krishna and Radha Rani rest after performing “Maha Raas”.

                        The Rang Mahal inside the Nidhivan Mandir is also a place of prime attraction. The pious room is
                        facilitated with all the essentials of Shringar, as it is believed that Sri Radha Rani and Lord
                        Krishna reside in the room even today. The Nidhivan temple in Vrindavan Forest is a holy place that
                        celebrates the Lords presence even today.
